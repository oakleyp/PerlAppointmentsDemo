# Perl Appointments Demo

### An extremely simple app to make appointments using a perl cgi script that posts to and searches a SQLite DB via AJAX

**To run this demo correctly, you must enable the proper apache modules and add a path to the `bin` folder as a `<Directory>` in `httpd.conf`, as well as have the permissions for this folder set to 755, and AllowOverride permissions or cgi and pl execution permissions for the same `<Directory>`**

Ideally, I will have an ant script to build this demo correctly by the next commit.
